<div align="center"> <h1> Contador / Glassmorphism </h1></div>

Challenge six was to create a glassmorphism which is an attempt to simulate a film of glass in the application, and challenge 7 was to create a counter.

I created a word and letter counter, in this counter's container I applied glassmorphism.
